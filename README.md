# Multibox Software by i2ichardt


## Overview

Multibox Software is a versatile tool designed for multiboxing on World of Warcraft Private Servers. While its primary focus is on WoW, the software can be adapted for various use cases. Currently configured for dual-client setup, the main window is used for gameplay, while a secondary window receives replicated inputs. The software can be easily modified to support additional clients.

## Features

  - The program's main interface provides a user-friendly experience upon loading.
  - Select a target window from the available list to copy and send inputs.
  - Use the "REFRESH LIST" button to update the list of available target windows.

- **Settings Interface:**
  - The settings interface allows customization for optimal multiboxing on WoW.
  - Specifically designed for WoW multiboxing, it includes options to prevent sending specific inputs (Q, W, A, S, D, or E) to the secondary character.
  - Note: Settings are not currently saved between sessions, requiring reconfiguration upon each software run.
