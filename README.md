  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software I made to Multibox on World of Warcraft Private Servers.<br>
  It isn't locked in to WOW only so i'm sure there could be other uses for it.<br>
  <br>
  Currently only setup to handle two clients; could be easily change to work with more.<br>

  <h1>Main interface:</h1>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the program looks like right after you load the program.<br>
  At this point you still need to select a target window from the available targets to copy and send the inputs.<br>
  If the window you want to target isn't in the list already then click the "REFRESH LIST" button and click on the<br>
  window in the list.

  <h1>Main interface: With a Target Selected</h1>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what the program looks like after you select a target window.<br>
  The target window is the window that you want to copy your inputs too; so not the main window you<br>
  will be playing on.

  <h1>Settings interface:</h1>
  <p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the settings interface. When using this software to multibox on WOW<br>
  I would put the secondary character on FOLLOW too the main character i was playing. If you send Q,W,A,S,D,or E<br>
  to the secondary character it would cancel them following the main toon. So I added these settings to stop<br>
  sending those inputs to the secondary character.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that I'm not currently saving the 'Settings'; so the next time you run the<br>
  software you will have to exclude the keys again.
